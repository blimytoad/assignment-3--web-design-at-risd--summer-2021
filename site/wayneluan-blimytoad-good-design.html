  <h1>Ten Principles of Good Design</h1>
  <h4><ger>by Dieter Rams, designed by Wayne Luan</ger></h4>
  <h2>Good design...<br> </h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column left"><h3><span class="periwinkle">Is innovative.</span>
      <br><br><br><span class="cadmiumYellow">Makes a product useful. </span>
      <br><br><br><span class="fuschia">Is aesthetic.</span><br><br><br>
      <span class="cerulean">Makes a product understandable.</span><br><br>
      <span class="stone">Is unobtrusive.</span><br><br><br><span class="vermillion">
      Is honest.</span><br><br><br><span class="coral">Is long-lasting.</span>
      <br><br><span class="violet">Is thorough down to the last detail.</span>
      <br><br><span class="moneyGreen">Is environmentally friendly. </span><br><br><br>Is as little design as possible.</h3>

    <div class="column right"><h3><reg> <span class="periwinkle">The possibilities for progression are not, by any means,
    exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities
    for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with
    improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</span></reg><br><br>

<reg><span class="cadmiumYellow">A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not
only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design
emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could
detract from it.</span></reg><br><br>

<reg><span class="fuschia">The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their
well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</span></reg><br><br>

 <reg><span class="cerulean">It clarifies the product’s structure. Better
still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of
the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.</span></reg><br><br>

<reg><span class="stone">Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither
decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both
neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.</span></reg><br><br>

 <reg><span class="vermillion">It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or
valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer
with promises that cannot be kept.</span></reg><br><br>

 <reg><span class="coral">It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears
antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s
throwaway society.</span></reg><br><br>

 <reg><span class="violet">Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and
   accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.
</span></reg><br><br>

<reg><span class="moneyGreen">Design makes an important contribution to the
preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical
and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</span><br><br>

 <reg>Less, but better — because it concentrates on
the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.
Back to purity, back to simplicity.<br><br></reg>
